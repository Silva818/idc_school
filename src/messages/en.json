Two months ago I decided to try — and it turned out to be the best decision. I started calisthenics from zero, and two months is of course not enough to talk about incredible progress, but even now I can see that I feel and control my body better, and because of that my strength numbers in the gym improved too. I like that the exercises are varied and there’s always a small step forward.

For a year now I’ve been training calisthenics with you and it exceeded all my expectations! My strength has increased a lot, and at the same time I became more flexible, solid, and enduring. My body settled into a nice shape, even though I didn’t lose much weight (because I refuse to go on a strict diet). Coach Dasha often sends extra videos to explain unclear details. We set shared goals and work towards them. And of course, what’s very important to me — I can train when it’s convenient for ME. Love you! Wishing you many years of success! ❤️",

At first it was quite easy, now they adjusted the load and many exercises are already challenging, which is exciting) And there is progress, of course — it’s a great feeling when you get stronger and an exercise becomes easier!

          "question": "Is this suitable if I’ve never trained before?",
          "answer": "Yes. We start with a strength test and simple exercises to understand your level. The program scales to you: from the most basic movements to skills. No “compare to norms” — we only compare you today with you in a few weeks."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does one workout take?",
          "answer": "On average 30–60 minutes depending on the format and your level. For beginner programs it’s closer to 30–40 minutes. You can train at home, outdoors, or in a gym—whatever feels more comfortable."

        {
          "question": "Do I need a pull-up bar or a gym?",
          "answer": "At the very beginning you can train without a gym: some programs are designed for home workouts. But to progress in pull-ups and skills, a pull-up bar or access to a playground is still needed. We’ll tell you the minimal setup worth starting with."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does the coach give feedback on technique?",
          "answer": "You record one set on video and upload it to the app. The coach watches, points out mistakes, gives comments and corrections. Based on that, they build your next workout or adjust the current block so you progress safely."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if I miss workouts or fall out of schedule?",
          "answer": "That’s normal—life doesn’t always fit a perfect plan. If you miss something, you just return to the program where you left off. The coach can adapt the plan to your new reality: reduce volume, change frequency, or rebuild the week."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I change the course or goal during a training block?",
          "answer": "Yes. You buy a training block, not a rigid commitment to one course. If during the process you want to shift focus—for example from pull-ups to a handstand—discuss it with the coach and they’ll adapt the program."
